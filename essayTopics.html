					<li data-theme="b">What is rape's significance in the novel?</li>
					<li data-theme="d">The act of rape, a perverse action that takes an act of love and turns it into an act of violence or punishment, is a key force in the novel.</li>
					<li data-theme="c">When Hassan is raped as a young boy Amir is presented with a tough decision, face the boys who are attempting to rape his friend and risk the opportunity to please his father by returning with the kite, or watch passivly stand by as his friend is raped and hope he isn't noticed.</li>
					<li data-theme="d">Amir stands by as Hassan is raped, and thus alters the course of both his and Hassan's life forever.</li>
					<li data-theme="c">Amir cannot stand to be friends with Hassan following this out of shame for what happened, however once Amir becomes a teenager and later an adult, his shame for his actions only gets worse.</li>
					<li data-theme="d">Amir spends his whole life trying to atone for what happened on that day.</li>
					<li data-theme="c">It is ironic that a situation involving rape allows Amir to make up for Hassan's rape, as Hassan's orphaned son has been taken prisoner and is used for sex.</li>
					<li data-theme="d">Amir stands up to his captors and frees Hassan's son, offering him new life, and in a way offering Amir new life.</li>
					<li data-theme="c">Rape proves a significant role on someone emotionally, as both Hassan and his son suffered greatly to cope with what happened to them, Hassan with silence and submissive behavior, and the same with his son, who even tries to kill himself.</li>
					<li data-theme="d">In rape someone is able to dominate another physically, and much the same emotionally, however this is much longer lasting.</li>
				</ul>
				
				<ul data-role="listview" data-inset="true">
					<li data-theme="b">Explain some of the examples of irony in the novel.</li>
					<li data-theme="d">During the novel Amir faces many instances of irony as the consequences to his actions.</li>
					<li data-theme="c">For instance, when Amir fails to act in stopping Assef from raping Hassan, he is doing so because he is more interested in how he could benefit from the situation.</li>
					<li data-theme="d">Amir believes that by avoiding this difficult situation he can return the blue kite to his father and gain his fathers respect and love.</li>
					<li data-theme="c">Though at first Baba is extremely proud of this, once he learns of Hassan's rape the kite is less significant, not to mention Amir loses his best friend during the process.</li>
					<li data-theme="d">Later on in the novel Amir learns that Hassan was actually Baba's son.</li>
					<li data-theme="c">This information shows that Amir is much more like his father than he believed as both of them betrayed their best friends for personal gain.</li>
