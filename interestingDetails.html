					This novel is not a sequel to The Kite Runner, however it focuses on similar topics and plights,

					It also went on to be a best seller.</li>

					<li data-theme="d">Hosseini is an Afghan born American citizen. He was born around the same

					However at much less of an extent than his protagonists, as he moved to Iran at a young age, 
					and eventually moved to France and then America.</li>
